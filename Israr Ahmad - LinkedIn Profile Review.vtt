<v 0>Hi Israelis. So we are here to do your LinkedIn profile review.</v>

2
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.850
I really liked the image that we have at the top.

3
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.510
I feel like that speaks to being a part of a community of being

4
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.540
a part of something. I don't know exactly what,

5
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.390
but I like it. And I feel like it's engaging and pulls people in.

6
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.210
I think your headshot is great. I wouldn't change anything there.

7
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.700
I think your headline is where you're going to want to spend the most

8
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.330
time. So especially if you're coming at it from a job seeker perspective,

9
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.640
you want to make sure you're addressing who you are,

10
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.490
who you help, how you help them and the results that you generate.

11
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.370
So those are like four things that you really want to make sure to

12
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.910
get into that section. Especially think about,

13
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.360
who's going to be looking at your profile, which jobs you're applying for,

14
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.390
make sure the right keywords are in your headline because they are going to

15
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.410
look you up on LinkedIn.

16
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.220
<v 0>Then the about section, you definitely want to flesh this out more.</v>

17
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.830
So you have 2,600 characters to work with here.

18
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.620
Don't copy what you have on a resume or a cover letter.

19
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.350
That's not going to work here. You're going to want to focus on a

20
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.590
little bit more of your story, even if it's just a few paragraphs about

21
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.550
how you got from there to here a little bit about your background what

22
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.930
you specialize in and think about it from a job seeker's point of view

23
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.810
and from somebody who would hire you, what are they going to going to

24
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.930
want to read here? Because that's going to be really important to get on

25
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.540
their radar and to kind of bolster your credibility.

26
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.470
It just looks really blank right now activity and your followers are good.

27
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.370
So you're above that 500 plus mark. I would think about the comments and

28
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.280
the activity that you are engaging in on LinkedIn.

29
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.650
<v 0>Add comments that are a little bit more thoughtful look for pieces</v>

30
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.130
of content that you can comment on that are related to your area of

31
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.720
expertise. Add an insightful comment because when recruiters or hiring managers

32
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.150
are looking at your profile, they're going to see them show up here.

33
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.510
And if they see something good, you are going to look very qualified and

34
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.870
like a qualified candidate with your experience,

35
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.910
if there's a LinkedIn page that you can link to here,

36
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.280
those are going to look better than what is showing up now,

37
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.800
if not, there's really not that much you can do about it.

38
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.320
I think it's fine. I would change.

39
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.130
Instead of having bullets here, I would change this to like a two to

40
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.440
three sentence overview of what you did in each role.

41
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.500
I feel like that's a little better. Like this one here, the Upwork one

42
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.670
is a little better.

43
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.670
<v 0>Like how you wrote that. If you could do that for these top two,</v>

44
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.400
I think that would look better. Education is good.

45
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.590
Oh, it's a group photo after. Okay.

46
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.870
That's cool. So that's what's up at, at UpTop now.

47
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.080
I know what it is. Let's see. Education looks excellent.

48
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.220
Licenses, certifications. Those are good. If there's anything else that needs to be added

49
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.770
related to what you're applying for job wise,

50
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.280
make sure that's in here as well. Skills and endorsement.

51
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.080
Wow. Okay, cool. So you've done the different LinkedIn skill assessments.

52
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.660
Those are good, especially if you don't have many endorsements yet.

53
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.150
So it's good that you've done those accomplishments.

54
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.730
Anything else that you can add under here would be great?

55
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.050
I'm not sure. If there's,

56
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.620
yeah, these are okay. Like I don't think people are going to understand what

57
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.710
the new laptop means, but I think that's all right.

58
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.980
<v 0>I think the scholarships are a little better here than having a new laptop</v>

59
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.050
listed here, but you did add a description here,

60
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.410
so I think it's okay. Languages, that's great that you speak multiple languages.

61
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.140
I'm sure that's very important in your space.

62
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.800
If there are additional skills that you can list here,

63
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.000
make sure you're using all 50 and especially anything that's related to jobs you're

64
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.400
applying for. So what key words are they looking for?

65
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.610
Make sure they are in the skill section because a lot of times they

66
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.200
will look you up on LinkedIn and they will use those key words to

67
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.140
make sure your profile has them. So just something to think about,

68
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.420
hopefully that's helpful. If you have additional questions,

69
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.930
just let me know.
